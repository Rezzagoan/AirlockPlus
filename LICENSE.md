Contingency Clauses
-------------------
The following clauses provide for continuity of the mod in case of unforeseen circumstances.  
Note that these permissions may be modified or revoked without notice at any time, for any reason.

**A: Recompiling for compatibility with new versions of KSP**

In the event that:
- A new version of KSP (excluding pre-release versions) causes the existing release of the mod to be no longer compatible.
- The incompatibility can be resolved by recompiling the mod's source code, *without modification*, against the new KSP version.
- The author/maintainer of the mod has not been active on both the KSP forums and on GitHub for a continuous duration of ten (10) days.
- A post in the mod's forum thread, @mentioning the author/maintainer, has not received a response after an *additonal* five (5) days.

When *all* of the above conditions have been met, permission is granted to recompile the source code, *as-is and without modification*, and release the resulting binaries (.dll only) by posting in the mod's KSP forum thread.  
Such a release:
- Must be clearly marked as UNOFFICIAL, indicate the KSP version number that it is intended for, and note the version number of the source code that was used.
- Must not require payment, and may not be used to solicit for donations.
- Must be removed upon being superceded by an official release of the mod, or upon request of the mod author/maintainer.


**B: Modifying for compatibility with new versions of KSP**

In the event that:
- A new version of KSP (excluding pre-release versions) causes the existing release of the mod to be no longer compatible.
- The incompatibility cannot be resolved by a simple recompilation, and would require modification of the mod's source code.
- The author/maintainer of the mod has not been active on both the KSP forums and on GitHub for a continuous duration of thirty (30) days.
- A post in the mod's forum thread, @mentioning the author/maintainer, has not received a response after an *additonal* ten (10) days.

When *all* of the above conditions have been met, permission is granted to fork the mod's GitHub project, make the necessary changes for compatibility with KSP, and release the resulting binaries by posting in the mod's KSP forum thread.  
Such a release:
- May only address compatibility issues with KSP, and must not introduce new features or functionality.
- Must be clearly marked as UNOFFICIAL, and indicate the KSP version number that it is intended for. Do not increment the official version number.
- The modified source code must be made publicly available to comply with the official Add-on Posting Rules.
- Must not require payment, and may not be used to solicit for donations.
- Must be removed upon being superceded by an official release of the mod, or upon request of the mod author/maintainer.


**C: Adoption of ophaned project**

In the event that:
- The author/maintainer of the mod has not been active on both the KSP forums and on GitHub for a continuous duration of five (5) months after clause (B) above has been exercised on the most recent version of the mod available on GitHub.
- A further attempt to make contact with the author/maintainer by means of @mention *and* personal messaging on the KSP forums has not received a response after an *additonal* fifteen (15) days.

When *all* of the above conditions have been met, the most recent version of the mod available on GitHub may be considered to be released under a CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 International license, with the following caveats:
- All derivative work must credit this original version.
- The name of the mod must be changed, to reflect that it is a fork of the original.
- Using a variation of the original name, such as "AirlockPlus Continued", is permitted only if the new project is a faithful continuation that provides fundamentally unchanged functionality as per the description in [README.md](https://github.com/cake-pie/AirlockPlus/blob/master/README.md).


**D: Unavailability of official KSP forums**

In the event that the KSP forums at http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com cease to exist without an official replacement, the requirements for attempting to establish contact with the mod author/maintainer in clauses A, B and C above may be fulfilled instead by [posting a GitHub issue on this project](https://github.com/cake-pie/AirlockPlus/issues).
